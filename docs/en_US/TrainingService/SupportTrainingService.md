# Supported TrainingService

TrainingService is a concept of training platform that run trial jobs on the corresponding platform. NNI support [local](https://github.com/microsoft/nni/blob/master/docs/en_US/TrainingService/LocalMode.md), [remote](https://github.com/microsoft/nni/blob/master/docs/en_US/TrainingService/RemoteMachineMode.md), [pai](https://github.com/microsoft/nni/blob/master/docs/en_US/TrainingService/PaiMode.md), [kubeflow](https://github.com/microsoft/nni/blob/master/docs/en_US/TrainingService/KubeflowMode.md) and [frameworkcontroller](https://github.com/microsoft/nni/blob/master/docs/en_US/TrainingService/FrameworkControllerMode.md) training service. 


|TrainingService|Brief Introduction|
|---|---|
|[__local__](#local)|Local mode means that NNI will run the trial jobs and nniManager process in local machine.|
|[__remote__](#remote)|NNI supports running an experiment on multiple machines through SSH channel, called remote mode. NNI assumes that you have access to those machines, and already setup the environment for running deep learning training code. NNI will submit the trial jobs in remote machine, and schedule suitable machine with enouth gpu resource if specified.|
|[__pai__](#pai)|NNI supports running an experiment on [OpenPAI](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai) (aka pai), called pai mode. Before starting to use NNI pai mode, you should have an account to access an [OpenPAI](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai) cluster. See [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai#how-to-deploy) if you don't have any OpenPAI account and want to deploy an OpenPAI cluster. In pai mode, your trial program will run in pai's container created by Docker.|
|[__Kubeflow__](#Kubeflow)|NNI supports running experiment on [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow), called kubeflow mode. Before starting to use NNI kubeflow mode, you should have a Kubernetes cluster, either on-premises or [Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), a Ubuntu machine on which [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) is setup to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. If you are not familiar with Kubernetes, [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) is a good start. In kubeflow mode, your trial program will run as Kubeflow job in Kubernetes cluster.|
|[__FrameworkController__](#FrameworkController)|NNI supports running experiment using [FrameworkController](https://github.com/Microsoft/frameworkcontroller), called frameworkcontroller mode. FrameworkController is built to orchestrate all kinds of applications on Kubernetes, you don't need to install Kubeflow for specific deep learning framework like tf-operator or pytorch-operator. Now you can use FrameworkController as the training service to run NNI experiment.|
